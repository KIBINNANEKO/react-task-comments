Task #1: Comments

Conditions of the problem:

Write a web application that will request other people's comments via the API, and allow the user to leave their own.

1. Initial loading - data from https://dummyjson.com/comments  
2. User can add comment using form  User can delete any comment  
3. If user typed something in the comment area and reloaded the  page, text must appears in the <textarea> (save into local storage)  
4. Design is just example (no need pixel perfect :))

Technology stack:
- HTML, SCSS
- JS
- React
- Redux + Redux Thunk

Example:

What I would improve in a real project:
- Would add a loading skeleton
- Better comment text validation
- More animations
- Static or dynamic pagination for loading comments
