t# Test Task #1: Comments

Disclaimer: Test tasks are made and exhibited as part of the portfolio solely for practice and demonstration of skills, and not for distribution of ready-made solutions. The names of the companies that provide them, I do not indicate.

Conditions of the problem:

Write a web application that will request other people's comments via the API, and allow the user to leave their own.

1. Initial loading - data from https://dummyjson.com/comments  
2. User can add comment using form  User can delete any comment  
3. If user typed something in the comment area and reloaded the  page, text must appears in the <textarea> (save into local storage)  
4. Design is just example (no need pixel perfect :))
